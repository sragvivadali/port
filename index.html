                        Principles of Engineering.
                        I have both short term and long term goals. To begin with, I would like to graduate from high
                        school and get admitted to
                        a good engineering college. Then, I would like to graduate with an Engineering Degree and work

                                        from my childhood, I was always interested in Engineering. I developed this
                                        passion by
                                        constantly seeing my parents solve problems using code and brother building
                                        numerous mechanisms to achieve a certain
                                        goal. Due to my role models being so immersed in engineering, I wanted to follow
                                        their footsteps and become an engineer
                                        myself.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Outside of school, I am a member of a VEX Robotics competitive team known as
                                        Gael Force Robotics. Our objective
                                        is to create a mechanism given the constraints to achieve a working solution.
                                        However, to achieve this, my team
                                        and I had to work countless hours on designing and building a plausible
                                        solution. This would lead me to work
                                        more than 10 hours on many days trying to figure out a new optimum method of
                                        achieving a working product. I
                                        needed to ensure that this product is completed in time, but also not let my
                                        grades slip. This made me have a
                                        good balance between robotics and schoolwork.

                                        In robotics, this is my third year in a competitive team. As a valued team
                                        member, I contribute by aiding with
                                        the construction of the robot, delegating roles for members, and help code the
                                        robot. I was also a member of the
                                        Tri-Valley Youth Expo, a corporation led by the Dublin mayor to plan out events
                                        that will occur in our
                                        community. In this group, my main role was to create marketing material that can
                                        advertise our events to the
                                        residents using social media platforms. Collaborating with my teammate weekly, I
                                        helped them reach out to
                                        investors using these marketing tools. In addition to these, I am also a board
                                        member for a non-profit
                                        organization called Reaching to Society. In this non-profit, we aid the nearby
                                        homeless shelters, farm for the
                                        residents, and also donate time and money to many other organizations who are
                                        trying to aid with preventing many
                                        deadly diseases. I am also a member of the Dublin High School Cricket team where
                                        we compete against other
                                        schools in the Tri-Valley. Finally, outside of my extracurriculars, I do a lot
                                        of photography. I do many types
                                        of photos and have an instagram for my photos, as well as a <a

                                            I have not used it in many years, bringing me back to square one.
                                            With my partner, Diego van Schie, I learned many things such as how
                                            to randomize the location of my character. Even though we only had the
                                            instructions of building a
                                            <strong>multi-level project,</strong> we worked together creating a
                                            fun game. We, however, had many ideas beforehand, finally deciding to
                                            choose a game about a wizard fighting his partner, and evil rouge wizard.
                                            The main character's powers slowly progress, leading to him having a
                                            "warping power", that allowed him to teleport around the map,and a lazer
                                            that will move to the location of the mouse. From each level, the
                                            character will gain one power at a time, making each level gradually
                                            difficult. At the end, we
                                            learned many values such as coding skills, teamwork, and the power of

                                            The design process was fairly
                                            simply. We started the project by creating a brainstorming chart
                                            and the constraints of the project. This allowed us to be able to
                                            imagine the code in our head. After that, we created a template
                                            on how we wanted to do the images as well as what the images will
                                            look like. We were happy with our templates and started working
                                            right away. With my partner's prior knowledge, we were able to create
                                            a strong basis for our images and what we need to work on.
                                            However, we made the code to complex that we didn’t understand
                                            a way to perfectly streamline the code. This made it a little
                                            more challenging. However, we were able to use the design process
                                            and create a good image manipulator. I also learned many concepts
                                            in Environmental Sciences. We were also able to develop on each
                                            other’s strengths. Since Loic is a senior, he has more research
                                            skills than me, causing it it be easier debug and create new ideas.
                                            Ultimately both of those actions led to positive ideas for the
                                            project but the whole process would have been more streamlined
                                            had we better communicated our intentions to each other. At the
                                            end, we learned the need of teamwork and

                                            <p>In this project, my team and I needed to create a functioning
                                            vechile using a solar and hydrogen fuel cell. During this
                                            project, my main contribution was to help build the mechanism.
                                            Since there were many awards for the designs, one being a
                                            creative award, I explained that we should build a motorcycle shape.
                                            This is due to a motorcycle having a relatively light shape,
                                            making it easily move faster. In this project, I was the
                                            lead builder as for I explained to my teammates the shape
                                            and structure of the vehicle. Going through the design procress
                                            numerous times, we finally created a functioning vehicle.
                                            This project was difficult due to voltage and current
                                            outputted by the hydrogen cells. These cells give so little
                                            voltage, it is difficult for it to move a "heavy" vehicle.
                                            At the end, I also created a 2D simulation on the parts of
                                            the vehicle to test and present the values similar to our prototype.
                                            I did this by using a GUI software called Netlogo and I simulated the
                                            vehicle in its many configurations. I also worked to finalize the

                                        <h1>Paper Rockets Design</h1>
                                        <p><strong>Objective: </strong>The objective was to design, create, test, and conclude on a specific projectile using paper and tape to travel the
                                        longest distance.</p>

                                            <p>In this project, my team and I needed to create a projectile that can travel a large distance. During this project, my
                                            main contribution was to create two designs of projectiles. For this project, we needed to create a projectile that can
                                            travel the farthest. This distance was tracked vertically. For my projectile, I decided to create a rocket. This rocket
                                            was created using printer paper and transparent packaging tape. When we were testing the rockets, I decided that 45
                                            degrees was the most efficient angle to launch the rocket and it traveled 31 yards in 10 seconds at 60psi. This was due
                                            to the wind catching the rocket and caused it to slow down faster. Seeing my mistakes, I created another rocket similar
                                            to the previous rocket. I created the body using two papers, cardstock and printer paper, decided to decrease the fins
                                            size so that it doesn't catch onto the wind. I also wrapped the entire rocket with duct tape and increase the
                                            compression of the rocket. This rocket traveled 88 yards in approximately 3 seconds. Another aspect of this project is
                                            creating a 2d simulation using NetLogo. Using Aerodynamic equations, I was able to create a simulation for a rocket
                                            launch adding factors such as wind and initial velocity. This helped me find the best angle of launch, testing them in
                                            the virtual simulation. I also worked to finalize the

                                        One engineering field I am interested in is Civil Engineering. Emma Schoental, a
                                        civil engineer, came to our school as a
                                        guest speaker on this topic. She explained the multiple types of civil
                                        engineers, as well as types of projects that they
                                        work on. This guest speaker showed me the daily life of civil engineers and I
                                        was inspired by the process involved in a
                                        project and the use of simulation and AutoDesk, showing the need for numerous
                                        engineering principles involved in a
                                        single project. This guest speaker showed me the background of one of the
                                        engineering fields I am interested in and also
                                        showed how the daily life of a civil engineer is like. Another guest speaker was
                                        Maynard Holiday, a member of the team
                                        involved in the containment of the Chernobyl Powerplant. He discussed the
                                        methods of using robotics to help diagnose the
                                        powerplant as well as the methods used to contain the radiation from the
                                        explosion. As a member of the Dublin High VEX
                                        Robotics team, one of my ambitions is to use my knowledge of robotics to help
                                        benefit the world. As someone who did it,
                                        Mr. Holiday helped me understand how they used robotics to accomplish something
                                        that a human could not do. With this, it
                                        helped me truly understand the robotics field, causing my interest to skyrocket.

                                        One field trip that I attended is the Jet Patriot Flight Hanger. There, we were
                                        taught about the process of rocket
                                        launching and the necessity to launch a man onto the moon by the many volunteers
                                        of the Patriots Jet Team Foundation.
                                        This inspired me about the ideas that can aid us with space travel. It also
                                        opened my eyes as to the difficult process
                                        in the development and process needed to reach Mars. This gave me a great
                                        perspective of aerodynamics and also showed
                                        that it could be part of my future career. Another field trip that I went to was
                                        the Lawernce Nation Laboratory National
                                        Ignition Facility (NIF). There, we were able to see the process of conducting
                                        experiments in the laboratory. They
                                        explained that they initially run many simulations before initializing the
                                        laser. This interested me because of my
                                        enthusiasm for computer sciences. By using the laws of fusion and light
                                        equations, the group can predict the output and
                                        how long a reaction will occur during the test. With running the simulation,
                                        they will not be able to get precise data
                                        before running the test, to ensure the safety of the scientist. This use of
                                        simulations helped show me a new method of
                                        using computer science compared to the known methods of web development and
                                        corporate data management.
