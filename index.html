                                        parents solve problems using code and brother building numerous mechanisms to achieve his goals. Due to my role models
                                        being so immersed in engineering, I wanted to follow in their footsteps and become an engineer myself.

                                        Outside of school, I am a member of a VEX Robotics competitive team known as Gael Force Robotics. Our objective is to
                                        create a machine to solve a year-long problem. However, to achieve this, my team and I had to work countless hours on
                                        designing and building a plausible solution. This would lead me to work more than 10 hours on many days trying to figure
                                        out a new optimal method of achieving a working product. I needed to ensure that this product was completed in time, but
                                        also not let my grades slip. This club has taught me what it takes to have a good balance between passion and
                                        schoolwork.

                                        In robotics, this is my third year in a competitive team, and I am currently the Development Team Captain. I contribute
                                        by aiding with the construction of the robot, delegating roles for novice members, and help teach members programming
                                        and the other fundamentals of robotics. I was also a member of the Tri-Valley Youth Expo, a corporation led by the
                                        Dublin mayor to plan out events that will occur in our community. In this group, my main role was to create marketing
                                        material that can advertise our events to the residents using social media platforms. Collaborating with my teammate
                                        weekly, I helped them reach out to investors using these marketing tools. In addition to these, I am also a board member
                                        for a non-profit organization called Reaching to Society. In this non-profit, we aid the nearby homeless shelters, farm
                                        for the residents, and donate time and money to many other organizations who are trying to aid in preventing many deadly
                                        diseases. Last but definitely not least, I have a large passion for photography. I try to learn the most I can with
                                        classes and experience while attempting to create my own spin on each photo I take. I post on Instagram and my

                                        <p>For this Scratch game, I needed to retrace
                                            my coding skills. Even though I have past knowledge of this language,
                                            I have not used it in many years, bringing me back to square one.
                                            With my partner, Diego van Schie, I learned many things such as how
                                            to randomize the location of my character. Even though we only had the
                                            instructions of building a
                                            <strong>multi-level project,</strong> we worked together creating a
                                            fun game. We, however, had many ideas beforehand, finally deciding to
                                            choose a game about a wizard fighting his partner, and evil rouge wizard.
                                            The main character's powers slowly progress, leading to him having a
                                            "warping power", that allowed him to teleport around the map,and a lazer
                                            that will move to the location of the mouse. From each level, the
                                            character will gain one power at a time, making each level gradually
                                            difficult. At the end, we
                                            learned many values such as coding skills, teamwork, and the power of

                                            The design process was fairly
                                            simply. We started the project by creating a brainstorming chart
                                            and the constraints of the project. This allowed us to be able to
                                            imagine the code in our head. After that, we created a template
                                            on how we wanted to do the images as well as what the images will
                                            look like. We were happy with our templates and started working
                                            right away. With my partner's prior knowledge, we were able to create
                                            a strong basis for our images and what we need to work on.
                                            However, we made the code to complex that we didn’t understand
                                            a way to perfectly streamline the code. This made it a little
                                            more challenging. However, we were able to use the design process
                                            and create a good image manipulator. I also learned many concepts
                                            in Environmental Sciences. We were also able to develop on each
                                            other’s strengths. Since Loic is a senior, he has more research
                                            skills than me, causing it it be easier debug and create new ideas.
                                            Ultimately both of those actions led to positive ideas for the
                                            project but the whole process would have been more streamlined
                                            had we better communicated our intentions to each other. At the
                                            end, we learned the need of teamwork and

                                            <br>
                                            <p>In this project, my team and I needed to create a functioning
                                            vechile using a solar and hydrogen fuel cell. During this
                                            project, my main contribution was to help build the mechanism.
                                            Since there were many awards for the designs, one being a
                                            creative award, I explained that we should build a motorcycle shape.
                                            This is due to a motorcycle having a relatively light shape,
                                            making it easily move faster. In this project, I was the
                                            lead builder as for I explained to my teammates the shape
                                            and structure of the vehicle. Going through the design procress
                                            numerous times, we finally created a functioning vehicle.
                                            This project was difficult due to voltage and current
                                            outputted by the hydrogen cells. These cells give so little
                                            voltage, it is difficult for it to move a "heavy" vehicle.
                                            At the end, I also created a 2D simulation on the parts of
                                            the vehicle to test and present the values similar to our prototype.
                                            I did this by using a GUI software called Netlogo and I simulated the
                                            vehicle in its many configurations. I also worked to finalize the

                                            <p>In this project, my team and I needed to create a projectile that can travel a large distance. During this project, my
                                            main contribution was to create two designs of projectiles. For this project, we needed to create a projectile that can
                                            travel the farthest. This distance was tracked vertically. For my projectile, I decided to create a rocket. This rocket
                                            was created using printer paper and transparent packaging tape. When we were testing the rockets, I decided that 45
                                            degrees was the most efficient angle to launch the rocket and it traveled 31 yards in 10 seconds at 60psi. This was due
                                            to the wind catching the rocket and caused it to slow down faster. Seeing my mistakes, I created another rocket similar
                                            to the previous rocket. I created the body using two papers, cardstock and printer paper, decided to decrease the fins
                                            size so that it doesn't catch onto the wind. I also wrapped the entire rocket with duct tape and increase the
                                            compression of the rocket. This rocket traveled 88 yards in approximately 3 seconds. Another aspect of this project is
                                            creating a 2d simulation using NetLogo. Using Aerodynamic equations, I was able to create a simulation for a rocket
                                            launch adding factors such as wind and initial velocity. This helped me find the best angle of launch, testing them in
                                            the virtual simulation. I also worked to finalize the

                                            For this project, I had to build and simulate a circuit that will have a real-life application to it. This design
                                            specification was an open-ended question, needing us to decide what our project needed to be on our own. For this
                                            project, I created an escape room that allows users to play the games at home even with the COVID-19 virus. For this
                                            project, I decided to make the game interesting by using a 3-bit counter and a AND and OR gate. This allows my project
                                            to have both conditional and sequential logic. For the project, I made the game challenging by having a 3 bit counter
                                            continuously run. With a switch, the user can toggle the 3-bit counter to run or stop. The game creates a challenge that
                                            allows the user to try to stop the correct 3-bit counter at the correct combination of LEDs. Then the user needs to get
                                            the correct combination of switches and if both the correct combination of switch and the correct combination of LEDs,
                                            the user won the game. For this project, I had to design the circuit online using a simulation software called multisim,
                                            and build the circuit using a protoboard system linked to software called MyDAQ. While building the breadboard, I used
                                            the built-in clock voltages with a frequency of around 1 Hertz allowing the user to have enough time for trying to solve
                                            the correct combination of switches. One challenge with building the breadboard was the lack of resources. With the
                                            shelter in place, having enough resources for building the mechanism was difficult. I fixed this issue by preplanning
                                            how to build the circuit on the protoboard. With this, I learned planning ahead and also wire resourcing. With these
                                            concepts, I was able to work on my other projects/activities without having these issues in mind. I also worked on creating a

                                    Work Experience is what distinguishes a great engineer from a good one. In the engineering academy, we are provided with
                                    numerous ways to grow and learn through experience. Apart from the enriching projects I do, I am able to meet with
                                    several industry professionals and learn from their experiences. I further my work experience through guest speakers,
                                    field trips/job shadows, and the mentorship program.

                                    One engineering field I am interested in is Civil Engineering. Emma Schoental, a civil engineer, came to our school as a
                                    guest speaker on this topic. She explained the multiple types of civil engineers, as well as the types of projects that
                                    they work on. I was inspired by the process for a standard project. I learned how there were numerous engineering
                                    principles required for a Civil Engineer and there wasn’t just one way to tackle a problem. Another guest speaker was
                                    Maynard Holiday, a member of the team involved in the containment of the Chernobyl Powerplant. He discussed the methods
                                    of using robotics to help diagnose the powerplant as well as the methods used to contain the radiation from the
                                    explosion. As a member of the Dublin High VEX Robotics team, one of my ambitions is to use my knowledge of robotics to
                                    help benefit the world. As someone who did it, Mr. Holiday helped me understand how they used robotics to accomplish
                                    something that a human could not do. It was exciting to learn that one of my favorite passions, robotics, aligns with
                                    what people work on in the real world to help humanity.

                                        One major field trip that I went to was the JA Job Shadow for Splunk. In this field trip, I was taught Splunk’s
                                        principles as well as their work in data sciences. The presenters discussed how the data they gathered propelled Splunk
                                        to be a major backend company for many other large corporations. The presenters that I met were an intern working in
                                        project management, and two data scientists. These presenters taught me how data is everywhere. Apart from the technical
                                        lessons, this field trip showed me how Splunk was able to have a fundamental work-life balance for their employees. It
                                        was great knowing that they can help the community while also ensuring their employees are treated properly. Another
                                        reason this field trip was interesting was that I was able to speak with the intern presenter. Being a PM and leading
                                        the sprint and storyboard has always been something interesting for me. I always felt like the PM was the leader for the
                                        people participating in the stories, who are in truth the brains for a company. Having the opportunity to talk to a PM
                                        intern allowed me to see what happens in the background. Another field trip that I went to was the Lawrence Livermore
                                        National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility (NIF). There, I was able to see the process of how they conducted
                                        experiments in the laboratory. They explained that they initially run many simulations before starting up the laser.
                                        This interested me because of my enthusiasm for computer science. By using the laws of fusion and light equations, the
                                        group can predict the output and how long a reaction will occur during the test. These simulations are very effective
                                        since they validate the safety of their employees and receive an estimate for what to predict. This field trip showed me
                                        that computer science is not limited to just web development and data management, but the possibilities are huge such as
                                        simulations like what NIF does.

                                    As part of the mentorship program, I can get an even closer look at my desired profession by meeting with industry
                                    workers, in either a one-on-one or group setting, to hear what insight they have and listen to their guidance. My
                                    wonderful mentor, Srinath Sura, is a manager at Facebook who has a lot of advice on how to pursue a career in computer
                                    science. One piece of advice that really stuck with me was when Mr. Sura discussed his definition of success. He
                                    believes that if someone is able to go to work and come back with a smile, they truly are successful. Along with getting
                                    advice from my mentor, the mentorship program also has professional building focuses where my mentor sits with me to
                                    work on my résumé and online portfolio. This has helped me a lot since I used to have a hard time putting myself on a
                                    piece of paper but with the help of Mr. Sura and other mentors, I can express myself better.</p>
